In the first question, I first looked at a competition for market share game, in which two companies can choose between markup and maintaining the original price. The payoff comes from combining the decisions of both men. However, I think Nashpy's analysis is wrong because he thinks both men should have chosen to raise prices. In this strategy, first of all, neither of them can achieve the maximum return, and second, both of them have to face the risk that their opponent chooses to maintain the original price while their return is zero. I think the Nash equilibrium in this case should be a pure strategy equilibrium, where they both choose to keep the original price.

In this strategy, both people get the maximum benefit of 4. If your opponent betrays your cooperation, your gain becomes 6. Take no risk in either case.

In the second question, I chose the ultimatum game, in which the first player proposes a distribution strategy, and the second player can choose to accept it or not. If the second player chooses not to accept this strategy, then both players get 0. If the second player chooses to accept this strategy, the distribution will be based on the first player's strategy, no matter how unreasonable the first player's strategy is.

SPNE's solution is that the second player chooses to accept the offer no matter what. However, I used the ultimatum game in my homework to point out that in practice, 60 percent of players will choose not to accept an unfair distribution, even if it means they will not receive any money.

Both examples demonstrate the limitations of Nash equilibrium. In the Nash equilibrium, we assume that all the actors are perfectly rational and that they want to maximize the benefits. In reality, however, human rationality is limited. At the same time, we can't rule out that some players will choose to act irrationally out of a simple sense of revenge.
